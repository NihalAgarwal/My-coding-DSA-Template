# My DSA interview Preparation Template
The repo contains:
1. **CS Notes :** The last moment Computer Science fundamental (CN, OS, DBMS, etc.) notes.
2. **Python code :** The directory contains python files that helped be analysed the algorithm and leetcode testcases, automate the repeated work.
3. **Zero_to_Google_SDE :** I chosen this name (Zero_to_Google_SDE) because when I was starting out, I didn't even know how to write a code for a simple problem like “Checking if a string is a palindrome or not” and my dream was to crack SDE @ FAANG (especially Google).
There are DSA Notes, helper classes and also contains Java files with pre-written code, which allow you to write your solution without having to handle repeated stuff (e.g., max-min value, 10^9+7 mod, graph neighbour check, object creation). 

The repository has grown and expanded greatly from when it firstly started. 
Fell free to raise PR. ❤
